# Castform Weather

A cute Pokémon-themed weather widget built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Tauri.  
Displays hourly weather data of the user's location, and updates the central Pokémon image and tips based on current conditions.

## Features
- Weather data from OpenMeteo API
- Geolocation support
- Celsius/Fahrenheit toggle
- My own digitally drawn Pokémon-themed UI! (images, icons, buttons, and background)
